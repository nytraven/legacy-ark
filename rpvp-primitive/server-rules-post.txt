[olist]
	[*]Offline raiding is allowed, although greatly discouraged by the use of ORP pillars.

	[/olist]
	[*]Any offensive structure that is used for a raid must be destroyed after the raid is done.
	[*]No Raiding your own tribe from within. IF you choose to leave a tribe, you leave with what the owner of the tribe says is yours, or nothing. This is to prevent complaints of inside raiding. F12 (screenshot) what the owner says is yours so there is no confusion.
