[code][b]BY JOINING AN ARK LEGACY SERVER YOU ARE AGREEING TO FOLLOW ALL RULES LISTED BELOW AND ARE AWARE THAT A FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN DELETION OF STRUCTURES/DINOS AND/OR A BAN.[/b][/code]

[h1]General Rule[/h1]

[b]This is a PVP Server, PVP is encouraged.[/b] However, keep in mind that if your actions border on harassment or griefing, this hurts the overall server population, you will first be warned and repeat offenses may result in a ban.

[h1]Legacy Admins[/h1]

[olist]
	[*]No aggressive acts against the admins. They don't engage in PvP, which allows them to focus on taking care of the server and community. Anyone caught doing anything to the admins (on purpose) may be permanently banned. 
	[*]No arguing with the admins based on decisions they make. (Take it to Steam/The Forums)
	[*]Some "Legacy" structures exist as community hubs for crafting/trading purposes.  While the structures are protected, players and dinos are not.
	[*]Some "Legacy" structures are built for your to raid, which will include special loot.  These will be clearly marked with a unique beacon when they're ready for raiding.
	[*]Some "Legacy" structures will be used for other events and will be protected from damage.
	[*]The primary "Legacy" castle will also be protected from damage and may also be used for some events.  Unless announced by an admin, PvP is not allowed at the Legacy castle.
[/olist]

[h1]Rules of the Land (a.k.a. Server)[/h1]

[olist]
	[*]No religious, racial, or homophobic slurs in global chat/tribe names/player names/dino names.
	[*]No soliciting or advertising of any kind without consent of an admin.
	[*]No cheating. The use of 3rd party programs (Aimbot, ESP, etc.), bugs, and/or glitches is strictly forbidden. This also includes Exploits of bugs or glitches.
	[*]This is a PvP server, expect PvP.  Nobody, especially the admins, want to hear your cries of defeat. Learn from it and play better.
	[*]Ark is still in development, which you may experience "bugs" that impact your castle and/or dinos.  The admins may not help with the search or restoration of any lost dinos.
	[*]Tribes are limited to 6 members.  Don't request to have this increased.
	[*]Don't even bring up the word "wipe" in chat for any reason.  If we feel that a wipe is necessary, we will start a discussion in the steam group.
[/olist]

[h1]Building Rules[/h1]

[olist]
	[*]Tribes are limited to 2 ORP pillars for offline raid protection. All other structures and dinos located outside of these ORP areas are considered free game and offline raiding rules don't apply.
	[*]Your protected structure is limited to the size of the ORP Bubble, choose your locations wisely.
	[*]No using another tribes ORP in any way/shape/form.
	[*]No Building on Obelisks, Artifact Caves, Floating Island, Penguin Spawns, Deep Sea Loot Crates, or the edge of the world cliffs (must be 4 foundations distance from edge).
	[*]Otherwise, building in all other caves and underworld locations are allowed, although greatly discouraged by taking 10x damage.
	[*]NO pillar/foundation spam. Clean up taming pens after use. If you are found in violation of this rule, the destroytribestructures command may be used (which may destroy ALL of your structures). Pillars/Foundations may be used within your walls.
[/olist]

[h1]Raiding Rules[/h1]

[olist]
	[*]Offline raiding is allowed, although greatly discouraged by the use of ORP pillars, which provide 10x protection.
	[*]No killing passive dinos.  You can tranq them or find other ways to move them, without killing them.
	[*]A tribe, or tribe alliance cannot raid an enemy tribe more than once every 48 hours. If the tribe that was attacked, then retaliates, they are fair game again.
	[*]48 hour recovery cooldown requests will only be granted if the raided tribe does the following:
	[olist]
		[*]Must post the request in the Steam group discussions within 12 hours of being raided.
		[*]The request must include a screenshot of your raided structure and tribe logs as proof of the raid.
	[/olist]
	[*]Any offensive structure that is used for a raid must be destroyed after the raid is done.
	[*]No Raiding your own tribe from within. IF you choose to leave a tribe, you leave with what the owner of the tribe says is yours, or nothing. This is to prevent complaints of inside raiding. F12 (screenshot) what the owner says is yours so there is no confusion.
[/olist]

[h1]Prisoner Rules (a.k.a. Caging/Torpor Sedation)[/h1]

[olist]
	[*]Prisoners must be at least level 70, unless they attack or are a member of a raiding tribe.
	[*]Prisoners may only be confined for 30 minutes outside of a raid.
	[*]Prisoners during a raid may be confined for the duration of the raid for both the attacking and defending sides.
