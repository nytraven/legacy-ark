[list]
	[*]No Metal Structures, No Explosives, No Fabricator (and all items that require one)
	[list]
		[*]For an enjoyable primitive gameplay experience.
	[/list]
	[*]No Natural Spawning Gigas, Titans, or Wyverns.
	[list]
		[*]These dinos are considered overpowered, especially for primitive gameplay in the stone age.
		[*]Admins may spawn a wild fire wyvern to escalate the risk in some areas (e.g. the volcano).
	[/list]
	[*]5x Gather
	[list]
		[*]Balanced gathering for builders.
	[/list]
	[*]10x XP
	[list]
		[*]Helps new players progress faster with player stats and unlocked engrams.
		[*]New players should hit level 30+, build a small keep, and have an ORP2 pillar for offline raid protection... within their first session.
	[/list]
	[*]10x Tame, 20x Breeding
	[list]
		[*]Faster taming and breeding allows players to enjoy the rest of the game.
	[/list]
	[*]Longer Days
	[list]
		[*]Get more done during the day.
	[/list]
	[*]Gamma Disabled
	[list]
		[*]Ark looks amazing at night, especially with torches, forges, and campfires.  This helps with the RP aspect of night gameplay.
	[/list]
	[*]Crosshairs Disabled
	[list]
		[*]This is the stone age... wtf are crosshairs?
	[/list]
	[*]Smaller Tribes (6 members max)
	[list]
		[*]Nobody enjoys mega alpha tribes, except the mega alpha tribe.  
		[*]This should encourage more friendly PvP engagements between tribes, including larger groups of players.
		[*]Most tribes are typically 1-3 members.  This will help the smaller tribes from becoming completely overwhelmed.
		[*]Smaller tribes may still form alliances, which offers a more political RP experience.
	[/list]
	[*]Structure Decay
	[list]
		[*]Abandoned structures won't become forever ruins.
	[/list]
	[*]Resources Spawn Close to Structures and Dinos (75% closer)
	[list]
		[*]Allows players to build closer to resources without risking disrupting them from re-spawning.
	[/list]
	[*]Resources Spawn Faster (2x)
	[list]
		[*]Reduces the need to travel far for extra resources.
	[/list]
	[*]Admin Command Logging (disabled)
	[list]
		[*]The admins don't participate in PvP.  They will be focused on building/preparing PvP events for the rest of the community to enjoy.  This would only flood the chat with commands as the admins spawn in resources and structures for the event.
	[/list]
	
	[*]Increased Sturcture Damage in Caves/Underworld/Underwater/Ruins (10x)
	[list]
		[*]Greatly discourage building in isolated areas.  The Center map is already a very large map above the surface, don't turtle in hidden areas.
	[/list]
	[*]Reduced Flyer Combat Stats
	[list]
		[*]Reduced damage for all flyers (50%), making them more viable for logistics (e.g. moving dinos and scouting) rather than for combat.
	[/list]
	[*]No Quetz Platform Saddle
	[list]
		[*]Reduces quetz abuse/exploits, while the normal saddle allows players to use the quetz more logistically for moving larger dinos.
	[/list]
